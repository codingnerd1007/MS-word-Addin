# MS-word-Addin
<p>•	We usually face problems in creating a word document, like clicking a lot of buttons to create a 
specific text format, which is time consuming.</p>
<p>•	So, we create certain buttons like chapter heading, section heading, subsection heading, which have
their properties like font, font size, etc. already set, and with a click of just one button we can set the
formatting, thus increasing user convenience.</p>
<p>•	we also create python scripts to highlight formatting problems like difference in font size and even detect
few words, which should not be the part of documents like SRS.</p>
